    "and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",

    "Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. \n",
